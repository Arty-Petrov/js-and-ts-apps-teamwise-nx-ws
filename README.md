# js-and-ts-apps-teamwise-nx-ws

## Description
This is testing work for potential employer.
This service consists from two apps:
- "Users" which can create, update and read records with filter by user is and pagination.
- "History" which stores Users operation log. Create history log action is bound to Users create and update actions by RPC call.

Both services have separate databases instances. 
>Users and has **TS codebase**, History written on **Vanilla JS** â€” this is main challenge of this task.
